# PRODIGY_DS_02
**Task-02
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.**

In the first step of data analysis and visualization, I import various libraries such as 'pandas' for data manipulation and  'matplotlib' for visualization, to perform tasks efficiently because libraries provide pre-built functions and tools for data manipulation and visualization.
In the second step, I uploaded datasets into the analysis environment. Because uploading datasets provides the raw material for analysis. 
In the third step, I understand the characteristics of the dataset. I explore the basic information about the data such as reviewing the first few rows of the dataset, obtaining summary statistics, and checking data types are preliminary steps in understanding your data.
In the fourth step, I start performing EDA. In this, I perform the following steps to explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data:
1. Uni-variate analysis   (I analyze data with respect to one column with the help of countplot, boxplot, and distplot)
2. Multi-variate analysis (compare two columns and analyze data with the help of boxplot, pair Pplot, and heatmap)
3. Feature Engineering  (I merge the similar column, remove un-important, and add important information column)
4. Detect Outliers  (handling outliers)
5. One-hot encoding  (I convert categorical columns in Numbers(0s and 1s))
